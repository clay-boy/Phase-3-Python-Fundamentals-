```
**Create and Activate a Virtual Environment (Optional but Recommended)**:

To keep dependencies isolated, create a virtual environment:

python3 -m venv venv
Activate the virtual environment:


- There are no external dependencies required for this project.

### Phase-3-Code-Challenge-Python-Fundamentals
<u>**Functions Implemented**</u>
- **add_numbers**(num1, num2): Returns the sum of two numbers.

- **is_even**(number): Returns True if the input number is even, False otherwise.

- **reverse_string**(text): Returns the reversed version of the input string.

- **count_vowels**(text): Returns the count of vowels (a, e, i, o, u) in the input string, ignoring case sensitivity.

- **calculate_factorial**(n): Returns the factorial of a non-negative integer n.

- **apply_decorator**(func): Applies a decorator that prints "Decorator Applied" before calling the original function.

- **sort_by_age**(people): Sorts a list of tuples containing names and ages by age in ascending order.

- **merge_dicts(**dict1, dict2): Merges two dictionaries. If there are common keys, their values are summed up.
